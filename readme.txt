RaCar Clear Cart for WooCommerce allows you to add a customizable button to clear the shopping cart.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add a customizable button to clear the cart. The button appears on the WooCommerce's cart page and when pressed, it asks for confirmation if the shopping cart should really be cleared. If the shopper clicks ok, it will remove all items from their WooCommerce shopping.

You may change the text for the questions. Also the position and colors of the button.

= AFTER INSTALL =

After installation and activation, on the plugins page, find RaCar Clear Cart for WooCommerce on the list and click 'settings' right under the title. It'll take you to the plugin's settings page. Another way of getting there is through the left admin menu. Find the RaCar Plugins handle and click it.

= HOW TO USE IT =

On settings page, choose your options such as colors and text and enable the plugin so the button will show.

The button itself is a '&lt;button type="submit"&gt;' HTML tag, has the 'class="button"' and 'id="clear-cart"', so you're welcome to add your own CSS to it. If doing so, leave the options on options page blank. In failing to do so, you'll have to use the '!important' to some of the elements such as 'background' and 'color'.

= RESET SETTINGS =
So far, the only way to reset your settings is unistalling the plugin and installing it back on. Just deactivating and activating will NOT reset settings, only the unistalling will. 

= Languages =

This plugin was written in English and has Brazilian Portuguese transalations. Este plugin est&aacute; traduzido em Portugu&ecirc;s do Brasil.
